Alzheimer’s disease is a complex neurodegenerative condition that emerges from multiple 
interacting biological processes rather than a single pathway. 
In practice, scientists often approach it through the lens of convergent mechanisms: 
if different models of disease—each emphasizing different aspects of pathology—nonetheless point to overlapping pathway-level signals, those shared pathways can be especially informative. The purpose of this task is to treat three established mouse models (5xFAD, 3xTG-AD, and PS3O1S) as three distinct but thematically related perturbations, and then to compare them at the level of KEGG pathway enrichment derived from differential gene expression.
Even though each model has its own biological emphasis, they are all used to study disease-relevant changes in gene expression across tissues, timepoints, or experimental conditions. Researchers typically collect biological samples, extract nucleic acids, and quantify gene expression in a way that ultimately yields count-like data: for each sample, a table of genes and corresponding measured abundance signals. These abundance signals are not directly comparable across samples until you account for factors like overall library size, variability, and the compositional nature of count data. This is why normalization is a core step: it does not “improve” biology, but it makes the measurements comparable so that biological signal is less confounded by measurement scale.
In real-world studies, the messy details can be substantial: animals may differ in age, sex, housing conditions, and other variables; batches can arise from sample handling dates, personnel, reagent lots, or instrument runs; and tissues may have varying cell-type compositions. While those details are important in the lab, your job here is not to invent experimental covariates. The biological motivation for using pathways rather than just lists of genes is that pathways offer a form of structured interpretation: a pathway can be viewed as a functional narrative (for example, immune response, vesicular trafficking, mitochondrial function, synaptic biology, protein homeostasis, and so on). In neurodegeneration in particular, it is common for multiple upstream causes to converge on shared downstream stresses. That convergence is often more visible at the pathway level than at the level of any single gene.
At the same time, be mindful that pathway databases are imperfect abstractions. A “pathway” is not a single physical object; it is a curated set of genes that human experts have grouped under a label. Different species mappings, gene identifiers, and updates to pathway definitions can affect enrichment results. 5xFAD is commonly used to model aspects of amyloid pathology and associated neuroinflammatory responses. In many contexts it is treated as a model where changes in immune signaling, microglial activation signatures, and stress responses may be prominent.
• 3xTG-AD is often used as a model that combines multiple pathological hallmarks and may show broader transcriptional remodeling with signals spanning synaptic function, metabolic stress, and inflammatory components.
• PS3O1S (PS301S) is often used as a model of tau-related pathology and can show transcriptional changes related to cytoskeletal dynamics, neuronal integrity, glial responses, and other downstream consequences.These descriptions are intentionally conceptual. They are here to remind you why a cross-model pathway comparison is meaningful: if pathways emerge as shared across these models, it may suggest a more general disease-associated program rather than a model-specific artifact.
What “differential expression” means here (conceptual, repeated for emphasis):
Differential expression is a statistical comparison that yields a per-gene signal describing whether expression differs across groups. The downstream enrichment step typically expects one of the following gene-level artifacts:
• A ranked list of genes by some differential signal (directional effect plus strength).
• A subset of genes flagged as “differential” by some criterion.
• Per-gene p-values and/or effect estimates.
Different enrichment strategies use different representations, but the key point is that the enrichment p-values you report should derive from a gene-level differential signal computed for each model.
Because the final output is at the pathway level, your internal choices should be consistent: do not mix incompatible gene identifier types without mapping; do not merge samples from different models into a single contrast if the task is to compute per-model enrichment; and do not output gene-level results instead of pathway-level results.
What “KEGG pathway enrichment” means here (conceptual, repeated again):
KEGG pathway enrichment is an interpretation step where you ask: given the gene-level differential signal, are genes belonging to a known pathway overrepresented among the genes that appear most changed (or among those meeting some evidence threshold), more than would be expected by chance? The enrichment result is typically reported as:
• Pathway name/identifier• Statistical significance (p-value)
• Possibly additional descriptive fields (counts, overlaps, etc.)
For this task, you must ultimately provide p-values per pathway per model in a combined table. You may compute and use additional internal fields, but the final CSV must include exactly the columns requested: pathway and the three p-value columns.
Why “shared pathways across models” matters:
A shared pathway is one that appears in the enrichment results of multiple models. Shared pathways can indicate convergent biology—common downstream responses to different upstream pathologies. They can also reflect generic stress, immune activation, altered proteostasis, or other broad processes. 
When comparing across models, two practical issues commonly arise:
1) Pathway naming consistency: the same pathway may appear with slightly different labeling conventions. If your enrichment output includes standardized identifiers, those can help align results. If not, you may need to match pathway strings carefully.
2) Missingness: a pathway may be enriched in one model but not another, either because it is truly absent, or because the evidence is weaker and does not appear in the reported enrichment list. In such cases, you still need a coherent CSV output. Keep intermediate results organized. Even though the only required output is the final CSV, creating intermediate artifacts can help avoid mistakes and support reproducibility.
• Avoid overcomplicating the analysis with speculative biological narratives. Neurodegenerative conditions are rarely driven by a single gene’s change in isolation. They involve shifts in cellular states: glial activation, neuronal stress responses, synaptic remodeling, altered energy metabolism, and immune signaling. Some changes may reflect cell loss or shifts in cell-type proportions, which can manifest as widespread transcriptional differences. At a pathway level, such shifts can produce coherent enrichment patterns even when individual gene signals vary.
Because these models can differ in the relative balance of neuronal vs glial signals, and because different pathological triggers can lead to overlapping stress responses, pathway comparisons help reveal common “themes.” In a typical experimental study, researchers begin by selecting cohorts of animals, defining experimental groups, collecting tissue samples, stabilizing biomolecules, and extracting nucleic acids. Quantification technologies yield raw measurements that then require computational preprocessing to become gene-by-sample matrices. These matrices may include gene identifiers, sample identifiers, and sometimes annotation tables describing the experimental groups. A p-value in this context is a statistical measure of how surprising the observed pathway association would be under a null model where the pathway has no association with the differential signal. Smaller p-values indicate stronger evidence of enrichment. When you place p-values side-by-side across models, you enable quick scanning for patterns:
• Pathways with low p-values across multiple models can be interpreted as shared signals.
• Pathways with low p-values in only one model may be model-specific.
• Pathways with moderate p-values across models might reflect weak but consistent trends, though interpretation depends on context.
 In many biological studies, the gene-level results can be difficult to interpret: hundreds or thousands of genes can shift in expression, many with small effects. Pathway enrichment compresses that complexity into a smaller number of interpretable categories.
 At the same time, KEGG is only one of many possible pathway resources, and its categories can overlap. A gene may participate in multiple pathways, and pathways may share gene members. Consequently, enrichment results can show correlated significance across related pathwys.

You are working with a comparative genomics dataset centered on a microbial genome from Micrococcus. The provided materials include FASTA sequence data (the underlying nucleotide sequence information) and GFF genome annotations (structured labels describing genomic features such as genes and their coordinates). The overall objective is to reason about gene-level evolutionary relationships and gene-neighborhood organization across genomes, with special emphasis on clusters of genes that appear to co-evolve and remain functionally conserved in a coordinated way.

This task is motivated by a broad and recurring theme in microbial genomics: genomes are not just lists of independent genes, but rather organized systems where groups of genes can be functionally linked, physically clustered, and evolutionarily coupled. In many microbes, genes that participate in the same biological process may be located near each other on the chromosome. When such proximity and shared function persist across evolutionary time, it can suggest that these genes form a cohesive unit of selection, or that they are maintained together because their combined presence provides a stable advantage. The key idea here is not merely “what genes exist,” but how sets of genes behave together across evolutionary histories—both in terms of sequence similarity and in terms of shared patterns of conservation, gain/loss, and association.

In this dataset, the notion of co-evolving gene clusters is central. A gene cluster can be thought of as a region of the genome where multiple genes appear in relatively close genomic proximity. Importantly, not all clusters are meaningful. Some genes may be neighbors simply by chance, and some genomes may exhibit rearrangements that scramble neighborhoods without necessarily breaking functional relationships. The focus of this task is specifically on clusters of orthologous genes—genes in different genomes that trace back to a common ancestral gene through speciation and that often preserve related functions. Orthology is a key concept in comparative genomics because it provides a principled basis for “matching” genes across different genomes. When we talk about “clusters of orthologous genes,” we are pointing to sets of genes where each gene has corresponding related versions in other genomes, enabling comparison across multiple genomic contexts.

Another important concept is co-evolution, which here refers to genes (or gene families) that show linked evolutionary behavior. Co-evolution can manifest in many ways in biology, and in microbial comparative genomics it often shows up as patterns such as: genes that tend to be present or absent together across genomes; genes that show correlated divergence patterns; or genes whose evolutionary relationships, when summarized across many genomes, appear to track one another. In everyday terms: if one gene is “there,” the others often are too; if one gene changes, its partners often change in compatible ways; and if one gene has a certain evolutionary distribution, its companions often show a similar distribution. Co-evolution does not necessarily mean that genes directly interact physically, but it does often suggest that genes participate in related roles, belong to a shared biological function, or are constrained by a common context.

Because microbes evolve through a variety of mechanisms, co-evolving signals may arise from multiple underlying causes. Genes can be inherited vertically from ancestors, but they can also be gained, lost, duplicated, or moved. Genes can be maintained together because they function together, because they are regulated together, because they are transferred together, or because their combined presence is required for a broader capability. In practical terms, a co-evolving cluster is often a unit that “makes sense” as a module: a set of genes whose collective presence supports a biological capacity that is meaningful at the organism level. That is why this task frames the end goal as grouping conserved clusters into co-evolving functional modules: units that are not merely adjacent on a chromosome, but that are biologically interpretable as coherent functional groupings.

The phrase phylogenetic reconstruction in the task statement refers to inferring evolutionary relationships and histories in a tree-like representation. Phylogenetics is frequently used to summarize how sequences or gene families relate across different organisms or samples. In concept, phylogenetic reconstruction attempts to capture a hypothesis of ancestry and divergence: which sequences are more closely related, which groups form shared branches, and how relationships may be nested. Importantly, phylogenetic reconstruction can be applied to many targets: whole organisms, individual genes, gene families, or combined units. In this task, the emphasis is on clusters of genes: rather than focusing on a single gene at a time, the reconstruction is centered on clusters of orthologous, co-evolving genes, reflecting an interest in whether certain multi-gene units share coherent evolutionary signals.

A conceptual way to think about this is: imagine a set of genes that tend to appear together in multiple genomes. For each gene, you can consider how its sequence differs across organisms. Across the cluster, you can consider whether the genes tell a consistent “story” about relationships—whether they behave as a coordinated set rather than as independent features. When clusters are stable and conserved, they can serve as meaningful units for comparative study. When clusters vary—some genes missing in some genomes, or rearranged, or diverged—those variations can also be informative, suggesting evolutionary pressures, ecological adaptation, or changes in functional demands. The aim is to identify clusters that are not only present, but functionally conserved and co-evolving across genomes.

The term functionally conserved deserves extra emphasis. Functional conservation is not identical to sequence conservation, although the two are often related. A gene can change at the sequence level while still performing a similar role, and conversely a gene can remain similar yet be used in a different context. Functional conservation in comparative genomics often refers to the persistence of a recognizable function or functional category across organisms. Sometimes this is inferred from annotations; sometimes from similarity to known proteins; sometimes from contextual signals such as gene neighborhood, repeated co-occurrence, or patterns of association with other genes. In this dataset, the presence of GFF annotations indicates that some gene-level labeling exists; those labels can serve as anchors for reasoning about likely functional identity or categorization. However, functional conservation is best treated as a pattern across genomes rather than a single fixed label. In many microbial systems, a cluster may maintain a stable “theme” (a shared biological purpose) even if individual genes vary in detail.

A closely related concept is synteny, which broadly refers to the conservation of gene order or neighborhood across genomes. When a gene cluster is syntenic, it means that the genes appear in similar arrangements across different genomes or genomic regions. Synteny can be strong evidence of functional linkage, because it suggests that the genomic arrangement is preserved by evolutionary forces rather than randomly shuffled. Still, synteny can be partial: some genes may be conserved, others replaced; order can be similar but not identical; spacing can vary; and rearrangements can occur. Thus, synteny is not an all-or-nothing property but a gradient. In the context of co-evolving clusters, synteny can provide one kind of signal that a set of genes forms a coherent unit.

When thinking about clusters of orthologous genes, it can be helpful to distinguish orthologs from other types of homologs. Homology is a broad concept indicating shared ancestry. Orthologs are homologs related through speciation, while paralogs are homologs related through duplication. In microbial genomes, duplication can occur and may complicate comparisons: multiple similar genes might exist within a single genome, and mapping “the” corresponding gene across genomes may not always be straightforward conceptually. This is one reason that focusing on gene clusters and co-evolution can be powerful: rather than forcing a one-to-one mapping in every case, you can treat the cluster’s overall structure and recurring gene families as the object of interest. Still, the task statement explicitly highlights “clusters of orthologous co-evolving genes,” so the conceptual expectation is that genes across genomes can be meaningfully grouped as corresponding counterparts in many cases.

The FASTA sequences represent the raw substrate for comparative analysis: the sequence content from which similarity, relatedness, and evolutionary divergence can be reasoned about. The GFF annotations represent structured metadata about where genes are and how they are organized. Together, these two file types capture complementary views: the sequence-level view and the feature-level view. This duality reflects a common theme in bioinformatics: to understand biological systems, you often combine the raw informational content (sequence) with human- or algorithm-generated interpretations (annotations). A key point is that annotations are descriptions, and while useful, they can carry uncertainty; meanwhile, sequences are precise but do not directly name functions. Comparative genomics often navigates between these two representations: using sequences to connect genes across genomes, and using annotations to interpret what those genes likely do.

This task emphasizes grouping clusters into co-evolving functional modules. A “module” here is best thought of as an abstract unit representing a coordinated biological function that is carried by multiple genes acting together. Modules are a powerful way to summarize complexity: instead of listing dozens of genes individually, you can describe a module as “a cohesive set of genes that tends to be maintained together across genomes.” Modules can correspond to biological pathways, structural complexes, defense systems, metabolic capabilities, transport systems, regulatory circuits, or other multi-component functions. Importantly, the task description does not assume a particular kind of module; it simply requires that you identify clusters that appear functionally conserved and then group them into higher-level modules based on co-evolutionary patterns.

To connect the idea of co-evolution to modules more explicitly: if multiple gene clusters repeatedly show similar presence/absence patterns across genomes, or show coordinated divergence patterns, or repeatedly co-occur in similar contexts, then those clusters may form a larger “module of modules”—a higher-order functional grouping. Alternatively, one module might correspond to a single conserved cluster, while another module might be composed of several clusters that are often found together but sometimes separated. Biological systems often display such variation: parts can be fused or split, moved or rearranged, yet still act in concert. The goal of grouping into modules is to capture this “concerted” structure in a way that is interpretable and stable across many genomes.

It is also worth reflecting on why microbial genomes are especially suitable for this kind of analysis. Microbial genomes are typically compact, and many biological functions are encoded in gene groups that must cooperate. Additionally, microbial genomes can show diverse evolutionary dynamics—some lineages may keep certain capabilities, while others lose them; some may gain new gene sets; and ecological pressures can shape which functional modules are retained. Comparative genomics aims to extract signals from these patterns: which functions are widespread, which are niche, which are lineage-specific, and which are associated with particular genomic contexts. Co-evolving clusters are one structured way of capturing these signals.

Even within a single genus such as Micrococcus, there can be meaningful variability in gene content and organization in a broad conceptual sense. Some genomes may share core housekeeping functions; others may differ in accessory genes related to environmental adaptation. When you see conserved clusters across multiple genomes, it often points to something stable and biologically important. When you see variability, it can hint at evolutionary flexibility or ecological differentiation. The clustering and module grouping in this task is therefore not just an abstract exercise; it mirrors how comparative genomics is used to identify core versus accessory functions and to map evolutionary relationships of functional capacities.

The sample dataset is a simulated dataset for finding the genetic cause of Cystic fibrosis. The dataset is real sequencing data from the CEPH_1463 dataset provided by the Complete Genomics Diversity Panel. It consists of sequencing of a family: 4 grandparents, 2 parents, and 11 siblings. A known Mendelian disease mutation has been added on three siblings, taking care to be consistent with the underlying haplotype (heplotype) structure. The goal is to find the mutation causing the Mendelian recessive trait — Cystic Fibrosis.

Cystic fibrosis (often abbreviated as CF) is a classic example of an inherited genetic condition that follows a Mendelian pattern in many families. In broad conceptual terms, Mendelian inheritance refers to traits that can be explained by the transmission of discrete genetic variants from parents to children according to predictable patterns. In the case of a recessive trait, the typical conceptual model is that an individual must inherit two altered copies of the relevant genetic factor—one from each parent—to express the disease. This means affected individuals often have parents who are unaffected carriers, and siblings can differ in status even when raised in the same environment. These ideas are foundational in genetics and form the reason family datasets are so informative: inheritance patterns provide constraints that can help distinguish a causative variant from the many other benign differences present in any human genome.

This dataset is framed around a family, which is important because families give structure. A family-based dataset is not just “many samples”; it is a set of biologically related individuals connected by ancestry and inheritance. Each person’s genome is not independent of the others. Instead, it is partially shared and partially unique, reflecting the fact that each child inherits genetic material from each parent, which in turn was inherited from grandparents. Even without focusing on any specific computational approach, the key conceptual point is that genetic variants tend to “segregate” through a pedigree: some variants will be passed down to many relatives, some to only a few, and some will appear in patterns that match a disease trait. When a condition is recessive, the distribution of the causative variant across family members often has recognizable features: affected individuals share a particular genetic state that unaffected individuals typically do not share in the same way.

Cystic fibrosis is often used to illustrate how recessive inheritance can operate in practice. In a recessive scenario, two copies are needed for disease manifestation, and people with only one copy are typically described as carriers. The carrier concept is central to Mendelian recessive conditions: a carrier can silently pass a disease-causing variant to children without showing the disease themselves. When two carriers have children, the children can inherit: (i) neither altered copy, (ii) one altered copy, or (iii) two altered copies. While real biology can include complexities like variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, the “textbook” recessive model is still extremely useful as a conceptual scaffold for identifying the likely disease-causing change in structured family data. 

A “variant” in genetics is simply a difference in DNA sequence relative to some reference or relative to other individuals. Variants can be small (a single-letter difference) or larger (insertions, deletions, or other structural changes). In everyday genetics language, people might refer to “a mutation” as if it is a special or rare type of change, but conceptually, a mutation is just a variant—its significance depends on context and effect. Many variants are harmless and are part of normal human variation. Every person has a large number of genetic differences, most of which do not cause disease. Therefore, one of the central conceptual challenges in Mendelian disease identification is not “finding variants” (there are many), but rather identifying which variant best explains the inheritance pattern and the trait in the family.

It is also useful to highlight the idea of “haplotype structure,” because it is one of the most important conceptual elements in family genetics. A haplotype can be thought of as a set of genetic variants that tend to be inherited together because they sit near each other on the same inherited DNA segment. Over generations, recombination shuffles segments, but long stretches of DNA can still be transmitted as recognizable blocks, especially within a family. 

Cystic fibrosis is widely recognized as a disease affecting organs that rely on fluid and salt balance, and it is often discussed in the context of epithelial physiology. However, for the purpose of a genetics identification task, the important point is that cystic fibrosis is a strong example of a Mendelian disorder with a clear genetic basis in many cases. The goal here is not to produce a clinical narrative or a medical management plan; rather, it is to identify the genetic change that explains the recessive trait pattern introduced into the family. Even conceptually, one can think of the causal variant as something that disrupts the normal function of a gene in a way that is compatible with recessive inheritance, where one working copy can often compensate but two disrupted copies cannot.

When interpreting a Mendelian recessive trait in a pedigree, there are several recurring conceptual signals. Affected siblings tend to share the key genotype state, parents often appear unaffected yet each contributes one copy, and unaffected siblings can be carriers or non-carriers. Grandparents can show carrier-like patterns depending on which line the variant originates from. The precise distribution can vary, but the core logic stays: the causal variant should follow the trait through the family in a pattern that is difficult for unrelated benign variants to mimic. This is why family-based genetics is powerful: inheritance itself is a filter.

Another important conceptual distinction in human genetics is between germline and somatic variants. Germline variants are inherited and present across essentially all cells of an individual, whereas somatic variants arise during life and may be present only in certain tissues. Mendelian diseases are typically caused by germline variants, because they must be inherited through generations. This dataset is framed around a family and a recessive trait, which aligns with germline inheritance logic. Thinking in these terms helps keep the focus on variants that behave like inherited alleles shared among relatives according to ancestry.

Variants can be classified in many conceptual ways. Some change a single DNA letter; others add or remove letters; others alter larger stretches. Some variants affect protein-coding regions, potentially altering the amino acid sequence; others affect regulatory regions, potentially influencing gene expression. Some variants have obvious disruptive potential, while others are subtle and their impacts depend on context. In a Mendelian disease context, a causative variant is often expected to have a relatively strong functional consequence, but “strong” can mean different things in different biological settings. Conceptually, though, the causative variant must be compatible with a recessive model: it should plausibly reduce or eliminate function when present in two copies, while a single copy may be tolerated without overt disease.

In practical genetics discussions, people often talk about “causality” in a careful way. A variant can be associated with a trait, but causality implies that it is the underlying reason for the trait difference. In Mendelian disorders, causality is often clearer than in complex traits because a single variant (or a small number of variants) can explain a large effect. Still, even conceptually, one must be careful: many variants can look suspicious if viewed in isolation. The reason a family dataset is so valuable is that it provides an additional axis of evidence: segregation with the trait. In a recessive trait scenario, segregation is a strong conceptual signal.

It is also helpful to define “Mendelian recessive trait” in plain language: it is a trait that tends to appear only when an individual has two copies of the relevant altered genetic factor. “Autosomal recessive” is the phrase often used when the variant is on a non-sex chromosome, but the key conceptual feature is the two-copy requirement. This also implies that the disease can appear unexpectedly in a family where parents are unaffected, and that the trait can “skip generations” in the sense that carriers may be present without disease. The presence of grandparents, parents, and many siblings in this dataset provides rich structure for observing that kind of pattern.

A large family with multiple siblings is especially informative because it increases the number of inheritance events observed. Each sibling represents a different combination of parental genetic contributions. Some siblings will share one parental haplotype segment; others will share the other. Over many siblings, one can conceptually observe how particular inherited segments correlate with the trait. Even without specifying any procedural steps, the conceptual point is that more siblings means more evidence about segregation, more opportunities to see carriers versus non-carriers, and a clearer contrast between affected and unaffected genetic patterns.

Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans are human fungal pathogens within the CTG clade of the Saccharomycotina. While C. albicans has long served as a canonical model for fungal pathogenicity, C. parapsilosis has distinct epidemiological and clinical relevance, including a notable association with infections in premature neonates. Understanding how these organisms regulate gene expression in different growth states is important for building a clearer picture of how pathogenic fungi adapt, persist, and interact with host environments.

This dataset consists of RNA-Seq samples from Candida parapsilosis wild-type (WT) strains grown under two contrasting conditions: planktonic growth and biofilm growth. The overarching goal of the analysis is to perform differential expression analysis to identify genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated between planktonic and biofilm conditions, with the intent of highlighting transcriptional changes associated with biofilm formation and maintenance.

To ground the biological context, it is useful to recall what is meant by “planktonic” versus “biofilm” growth. Planktonic cells are free-living and dispersed, often representing a relatively uniform growth mode in liquid culture. In contrast, biofilms are structured communities of cells that adhere to surfaces and frequently embed themselves in a self-produced extracellular matrix. Biofilm formation is not merely a change in where cells sit; it is often accompanied by broad physiological remodeling. Across many microbial systems, biofilm-associated cells can display altered metabolic states, changes in cell wall composition, shifts in nutrient acquisition strategies, and differences in stress tolerance. In clinical settings, biofilms are frequently discussed in relation to persistent infections and reduced susceptibility to external challenges, making biofilm-associated gene regulation an enduring focus of microbial pathogenesis research.

From the perspective of gene regulation, a transition between growth modes can be thought of as a coordinated re-tuning of the transcriptome. “Gene expression” refers to the process by which information encoded in genes is transcribed into RNA, with RNA abundance serving as a proxy—imperfect but informative—for how actively a gene is being expressed under a given condition. RNA-Seq, in turn, is a broad term for sequencing-based measurement of RNA molecules in a sample, enabling an empirical snapshot of transcript abundance across thousands of genes simultaneously. Importantly, RNA-Seq measurements reflect not only biological differences but also natural variability between replicates and the inherent randomness of sampling molecules from complex mixtures. As a result, comparisons between conditions benefit from statistical modeling rather than reliance on raw differences alone.

Differential expression analysis is the statistical framing used to compare gene expression between groups of samples representing different conditions. At a conceptual level, the key question is: for each gene, does the evidence support that expression differs systematically between planktonic and biofilm samples beyond what would be expected from typical variability? Differential expression is often described in terms of both direction and magnitude. A gene may be “up-regulated” in biofilm relative to planktonic conditions (meaning higher expression in biofilm samples), or “down-regulated” (meaning lower expression in biofilm samples). The magnitude of difference is frequently summarized as a fold change, and because expression differences can span orders of magnitude, fold changes are often considered on a logarithmic scale. While these conventions are common, the core interpretation remains straightforward: identify genes whose expression shifts in a consistent, condition-associated way.

It is also worth emphasizing that “significance” in differential expression is not merely a binary label but a concept tied to statistical evidence and the complexity of testing many genes at once. When thousands of genes are evaluated simultaneously, it is expected that some genes will appear to differ by chance alone. Thus, differential expression analyses commonly incorporate approaches that account for multiple comparisons, producing adjusted measures of evidence that help prioritize signals more likely to reflect genuine condition-associated changes. This is particularly relevant in transcriptome-wide studies where the goal is not only to detect differences but also to produce a reliable shortlist of genes for biological interpretation.

Biofilm-associated transcriptional changes are biologically meaningful because they can point to cellular programs involved in adhesion, community organization, extracellular matrix interactions, nutrient adaptation, stress responses, and broader remodeling of cellular physiology. Even without committing to any single mechanistic narrative, it is reasonable to expect that genes involved in surface interaction, environmental sensing, and resource allocation may show systematic differences between planktonic and biofilm conditions. At the same time, many observed changes may reflect indirect consequences of growth mode—such as oxygen gradients, local nutrient differences, or altered growth rates—rather than a single “biofilm switch.” This is one reason differential expression results are often interpreted as a map of candidate pathways and processes rather than a definitive mechanistic proof on their own.

Because this dataset comes from WT strains, the comparison focuses on condition-dependent expression rather than genotype-driven differences. “Wild-type” here indicates a reference strain background without a targeted genetic perturbation, which helps interpret observed differences as primarily associated with the environmental and physiological shift between planktonic and biofilm states. This framing is useful when the goal is to characterize baseline transcriptional programs tied to growth mode and to identify genes that may be implicated in the biofilm lifestyle.

"""
The experiment described here follows the general strategy of what is commonly known as an experimental evolution study. In experimental evolution, a biological population is allowed to grow and adapt over time under defined conditions, and researchers later examine what changed—both in observable traits and in the underlying genetic sequence. The guiding idea is simple: when a population experiences many generations, random genetic changes can accumulate, and some of those changes may become common because they are beneficial (or simply because they “hitchhike” along with other beneficial changes). In microbes like E. coli, this is especially practical because they reproduce quickly and can be maintained in controlled environments, producing clear “before vs after” comparisons.

In this setting, the “before” state is represented by an ancestor line, which you can think of as the starting genetic baseline for the experiment. The “after” states are represented by evolved lines, which are descendant populations (or isolates) that have undergone many generations since the ancestor. The goal is to identify genome variations in the evolved lines—differences in DNA sequence that arose relative to the ancestor and that may reflect mutation, selection, drift, and the history of the experimental conditions. Even when the experiment’s motivating question is biological (e.g., adaptation, stress tolerance, metabolism), the central output for this task is genetic: a careful accounting of sequence differences.

It is worth emphasizing what “variation” means in this context. A genome variation is any difference in the DNA sequence compared to a reference point. These differences can be single-nucleotide changes (often called SNVs), small insertions or deletions (indels), and sometimes larger changes such as duplications, inversions, or changes involving repetitive regions. In microbial evolution experiments, many consequential changes are small in size but meaningful in effect—like a single letter substitution that alters a protein, or a short deletion that disrupts a regulatory element. At the same time, not every detected difference is necessarily biologically meaningful; some changes may be neutral, and some apparent changes may instead come from noise, artifacts, or ambiguity in hard-to-measure regions.

Another important concept is that evolved lines can differ from one another in informative ways. If two evolved lines share the same variant that is not present in the ancestor, that could suggest a common selective pressure (or a shared history, depending on how the lines were derived). If each evolved line contains distinct variants, that could suggest different adaptive routes, random divergence, or selection acting on different targets. In other words, comparing the evolved lines both to the ancestor and to each other can help distinguish shared signatures from line-specific changes—without needing to assume that evolution follows a single path.

Because this is an experimental evolution scenario rather than a clinical setting, it can also help to clarify what this is not. This is not primarily a question about inherited human variation or population genetics in the usual sense. However, some vocabulary overlaps: for example, people sometimes use terms like “germline” or “somatic” in other domains, but here the relevant idea is simply baseline vs derived. The ancestor is the baseline; the evolved lines are derived. The key question is: what differences exist, and how are they distributed across the evolved lines?

The data are generated from DNA sequencing, which is a process that produces a large number of short sequence fragments that, when interpreted together, provide information about the underlying genome. Sequencing data do not arrive as a single contiguous chromosome string; instead, they reflect many fragments sampled from the DNA molecules that were present in the sample. This sampling process means that the observed data can reflect the mixture of molecules in the sample, and it can also reflect the practical realities of molecular preparation (for example, DNA extraction, library construction, and amplification can each influence what fragments are represented). These conceptual considerations matter because the task is ultimately to infer true genomic differences rather than to over-interpret incidental quirks of measurement.

The experiment includes three lines total: one ancestor line and two evolved lines. The ancestor line represents the starting point, while the evolved lines represent populations (or isolates) after evolution. Even with only two evolved lines, there is meaningful structure: variants can be (a) shared by both evolved lines, (b) unique to evolved line 1, (c) unique to evolved line 2, or (d) absent from all evolved lines (i.e., part of the ancestor baseline). Thinking in these categories can help keep the interpretation grounded: the task is fundamentally comparative.

Conceptually, when we talk about “calling variants” in an experimental evolution setting, we are trying to determine what mutations (or other sequence changes) arose during the evolution of the lines. In microbial systems, the evolved material can be a relatively homogeneous clone, or it can be a population with multiple coexisting genotypes. That distinction matters because a “variant” might represent a change present in essentially all DNA molecules from the sample (suggesting fixation or near-fixation), or it might represent a change present in only some fraction of the molecules (suggesting polymorphism, mixed subpopulations, or ongoing competition among lineages). Even when the final output is a simple list of variants, it is useful to remember that those variants are summaries of underlying population states.

It is also common in experimental evolution that some mutations arise repeatedly across independent lines, especially if those mutations confer a strong advantage under the experimental conditions. This phenomenon is sometimes called parallel evolution. Parallelism can appear as the same gene being mutated in different ways, or occasionally as the same exact change appearing in multiple lines. Conversely, it is also possible for two lines to adapt via different mechanisms, producing little overlap in the specific variants they carry. With only two evolved lines, you should still expect that either pattern is possible in principle: shared changes could indicate convergence, while distinct changes could reflect divergence.

Finally, it is useful to maintain a clear separation between describing the sequencing evidence and interpreting what it means biologically. The immediate goal is not to tell a story about why each mutation happened or what phenotype it produces, but rather to identify the set of genomic differences that separate the evolved lines from the ancestor. That said, the broader motivation remains: these differences are the molecular record of evolutionary history in the experiment. By carefully enumerating them, you create a reliable foundation for any downstream reasoning about adaptation, constraint, repeatability, and the relationship between genotype and experimental conditions.

The Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) NA12878 dataset is centered on a widely studied reference human sample that has been used across the community to understand how reliably genomic differences can be identified when sequencing data is compared against a human reference genome build (here, GRCh38). In practical terms, a “reference sample” in this context is not a reference genome itself, but a biological sample whose genome has been characterized repeatedly and carefully so that many of its genetic variants are already known with relatively high confidence. This makes it a useful anchor point for evaluating whether an analysis captures the expected kinds of variation found in a typical human genome and whether the resulting variant list is coherent and complete for the region under study.

This specific task focuses on germline variant calling in the NA12878 sample, restricted to a chromosome 20 subset. Germline variation refers to genetic differences that are present in the inherited DNA of an individual (i.e., in the cells that give rise to the organism), as opposed to somatic variation, which arises later in specific tissues or tumors. Germline variants are therefore expected to be present consistently across the individual’s cells, and they often represent the stable, heritable component of genetic diversity. Because humans are diploid, germline variants are commonly described in terms of genotypes, meaning whether the individual carries one or two copies of an alternate allele at a given genomic position (for example, heterozygous vs. homozygous alternate), while many positions will match the reference allele on both copies.

To avoid confusion, it helps to distinguish several related concepts. A reference genome (GRCh38) is a coordinate framework: it provides named sequences (chromosomes and contigs) and a standardized positional system so that variants can be described unambiguously. A variant is a difference between the sample and the reference at a specific location, such as a single-nucleotide variant (SNV), a short insertion or deletion (indel), or other small sequence changes that can be represented as alternate alleles relative to the reference sequence. Variants are typically reported with their chromosome, position, reference allele, alternate allele, and genotype-related information (e.g., whether the alternate allele is present on one or both copies). Even though the word “variant calling” sounds like a single action, conceptually it is the process of transforming sequencing observations into a structured list of differences from the reference genome, along with confidence-related annotations that help interpret whether a difference is likely real.

Exome sequencing, which is an approach that targets protein-coding regions and nearby sequences rather than attempting to capture the entire genome uniformly. Conceptually, exome data tends to concentrate evidence in particular genomic regions (exons and adjacent boundaries), meaning that some parts of the genome are represented much more than others. As a result, when reasoning about outputs, it is normal that some loci are well supported while others have limited or no usable evidence, simply because the input was designed to emphasize specific biological regions. The mention of “~75M reads” is a rough indicator that the dataset contains a substantial amount of sequencing observations, but it should not be treated as an instruction to tune any numeric thresholds or to assume any particular experimental settings beyond what is necessary to understand that this is a standard, real sequencing dataset. Some genomic regions are inherently more ambiguous due to repeats, low complexity, or other biological factors. Others are straightforward and yield consistent variant representations. When a task references a subset of a chromosome, it is usually done to constrain the scope so that the output is more manageable while still remaining realistic and biologically meaningful.

Chromosome 20 itself is one of the standard human autosomes, and restricting to a chromosome subset means that the analysis should concentrate on variants within the provided region(s) on chr20, rather than attempting to summarize or infer variants genome-wide. Genomic coordinates and variant descriptions must remain consistent with GRCh38 conventions, since the same position number can refer to different bases under different reference builds. In genomics, build consistency is essential: a “position” is only meaningful when paired with the correct reference sequence and coordinate system. For this reason, when reporting variants, it is important that chromosome naming and coordinate interpretation follow the supplied reference build context.

At a conceptual level, germline variants in a typical human sample include a mixture of common and rarer alleles. Many differences relative to the reference are benign and reflect population diversity rather than disease. The same kind of variant representation can cover a range of biological implications: some variants change protein sequence (nonsynonymous), some do not (synonymous), some affect splice sites, and many fall outside coding sequence entirely depending on what regions are represented in the data. Even in exome-focused data, some variants may be near boundaries or in nearby noncoding segments. Regardless of downstream interpretation, the core deliverable here is a faithful, structured catalog of the germline differences observed for NA12878 in the chr20 subset.

It can also help to clarify what this task is not asking for. It is not asking for biological speculation about phenotype, ancestry, or clinical risk. It is not asking for a narrative about what particular variants “mean” medically. It is also not asking for broader genome annotation or literature review. The central goal is to produce a germline variant callset for the specified sample and region, expressed in the requested output format, grounded strictly in the provided data and the GRCh38 coordinate system. The emphasis is on producing a clean and consistent set of variant records, not on interpreting them as clinical findings.

When people discuss variant calling, they sometimes conflate “detecting differences” with “proving truth.” In reality, variants exist on a spectrum of certainty depending on the evidence available, the ambiguity of the region, and the representation of alternate alleles. A robust variant set is one that avoids obvious internal inconsistencies (for example, contradictory allele representations at the same locus) and that uses standard conventions for describing alleles and genotypes. Since this is germline variation in a diploid human sample, many variants will be heterozygous, reflecting one alternate allele and one reference allele, while others will be homozygous alternate. Some loci may admit multiple possible representations of essentially the same underlying change (especially around indels), and it is normal for different representations to exist in principle; nonetheless, the output should remain self-consistent within the chosen representation style and within the constraints of the expected format.

The single-cell RNA-seq dataset consists of human skeletal muscle samples collected before and after acute exercise, sequenced with 10X Genomics. The task is to identify cell types and determine their transcriptional responses to exercise.

Skeletal muscle is a highly organized, adaptable tissue that supports movement, posture, and metabolic homeostasis. Although muscle is often thought of as being made primarily of contractile muscle fibers, it is more accurately understood as a complex ecosystem of many interacting cell populations. These populations include cells that directly contribute to contraction as well as cells that support structure, repair, blood supply, and immune surveillance. Acute exercise is a strong physiological perturbation that can shift the molecular activity of many of these cell populations, sometimes in coordinated ways and sometimes in cell-type-specific ways. Understanding how different cells respond to exercise at the level of gene expression can help clarify mechanisms of adaptation, repair, inflammation, and metabolic regulation.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (single-cell RNA-seq) is a method for measuring gene expression in individual cells rather than averaging signals across a bulk tissue sample. In bulk profiling, changes in gene expression can be difficult to interpret because the tissue contains a mixture of cell types, and the observed signal blends together both (a) changes in cell composition (for example, more immune cells present after exercise) and (b) true changes in transcriptional activity within a given cell type (for example, endothelial cells increasing expression of genes related to vessel remodeling). Single-cell profiling is designed to help disentangle these two effects by providing gene expression measurements for many individual cells. Each cell’s gene expression profile can be thought of as a snapshot of which genes are active in that cell at the moment the tissue was sampled.

In this context, “cell type identification” refers to assigning each profiled cell to a biologically meaningful category. Cell types are typically defined by stable features such as lineage, core functional roles, and characteristic gene expression patterns. Importantly, cells can also occupy different cell states, which are more transient configurations reflecting activation, stress, cell cycle, immune stimulation, repair, or other dynamic processes. A single cell type can contain multiple cell states, and those states can shift in response to exercise. Because acute exercise can induce rapid signaling cascades, it is common to observe short-lived gene expression programs that reflect immediate early responses, stress responses, inflammatory signaling, or metabolic shifts. These programs may appear differently across cell types, even when triggered by the same systemic stimulus.

Skeletal muscle tissue commonly contains multiple broad cellular compartments. The contractile compartment includes multinucleated muscle fibers, which present unique considerations conceptually because they are large, specialized structures. Surrounding and supporting this compartment are stromal and vascular cells that shape the microenvironment, including fibroblast-like cells that contribute to extracellular matrix organization and connective tissue maintenance, perivascular support cells that interact with blood vessels, and endothelial cells that form vessel linings and participate in angiogenesis and nutrient exchange. Skeletal muscle also contains resident stem/progenitor populations involved in repair and regeneration. A well-known example is muscle satellite cells, which contribute to muscle maintenance and regenerative responses. Depending on the physiological context, satellite cells may appear relatively quiescent or may show signs of activation and proliferation-related programs. Additionally, skeletal muscle hosts immune cells that can be present at baseline and can increase or change activation status in response to perturbations such as exercise, injury, or inflammation.

Acute exercise can influence skeletal muscle biology through multiple intertwined mechanisms. Mechanical strain can alter signaling pathways in structural and stromal cells, while metabolic demand can shift transcriptional programs related to energy production, substrate utilization, and mitochondrial function. Exercise can also cause transient microdamage and local inflammatory cues, recruiting immune activity that supports repair and remodeling. Vascular changes can be induced to meet oxygen and nutrient demands, potentially altering endothelial activity and signaling to surrounding cells. Hormonal and nervous system signaling during exercise can create systemic cues that affect gene expression broadly, but the downstream responses can still differ across cell types due to differences in receptor expression, intracellular signaling networks, and baseline functional roles.

The term transcriptional response to exercise refers to changes in gene expression associated with the exercise condition compared to the pre-exercise condition. Conceptually, this involves identifying genes and pathways whose activity differs between “before” and “after” states. In practice, it is helpful to think of transcriptional response as potentially including several kinds of patterns.

A useful conceptual distinction is between marker genes and response genes. Marker genes are genes that tend to be expressed in a particular cell type (or lineage) and help define identity. Response genes are genes that change with condition or stimulus and help define what the cell is doing (its state) in response to exercise. In real biological data, some genes can serve both roles depending on context, but the distinction helps clarify the objectives: cell type identification leans on stable identity signals, while exercise response focuses on condition-associated changes.

Because the samples are human skeletal muscle collected before and after acute exercise, it is also relevant that human samples can exhibit inter-individual variability. Biological differences such as baseline fitness, age, and prior activity can influence both cell composition and gene expression. Even when those factors are not the primary target of the analysis, they can create natural heterogeneity in gene expression patterns. This is one of the reasons it is often valuable to frame conclusions in terms of robust, cell-type-consistent patterns rather than over-interpreting subtle shifts in a small subset of cells. Exercise responses can also be time-sensitive: some transcriptional changes are rapid and transient, while others emerge later during recovery and remodeling. Thus, an “acute exercise” dataset often captures a mixture of immediate signaling responses and early stages of adaptive programs, depending on the timing of sampling relative to exertion.

In many biological systems, cells differ not only in their DNA sequence but also in which parts of their genome they actively use at any given time. A major way this “cellular state” is reflected is through gene expression, which broadly refers to how much RNA is produced from genes (and from specific transcript isoforms) under particular conditions. When a gene is expressed, its DNA sequence is transcribed into RNA molecules, and for many genes those RNA molecules can exist in multiple distinct forms due to mechanisms like alternative transcription start sites, alternative polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. The collection of RNA molecules that can be produced—especially the set of annotated transcript sequences for an organism or sample context—is commonly called the transcriptome. Even when two transcripts originate from the same gene, they may differ in which exons are included, their untranslated regions, or their overall sequence composition, and these differences matter because they can affect protein products, regulation, localization, and stability.

In practice, expression is not a single abstract value. It can be discussed at multiple levels: whole-gene expression, transcript-level expression, exon-level expression, or even finer features. Transcript-level expression is particularly important when isoforms have distinct biological roles, or when gene-level aggregation would obscure meaningful differences. Quantifying transcript expression therefore aims to answer a conceptually simple question: given a mixture of RNA fragments derived from transcripts, how much evidence is there for each transcript being present, and in what amounts relative to the others? This question becomes subtle because many transcripts share sequence segments (for example, overlapping exons), which means some observed fragments could plausibly originate from multiple candidate transcripts. The goal of transcript quantification is to resolve or appropriately account for this ambiguity and assign expression values that are consistent with the observed data.

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a widely used approach for measuring expression by converting RNA molecules into a form that can be read as short fragments of sequence. In real experimental contexts, RNA-Seq data reflects a combination of biological signal and technical factors. The biological signal includes which transcripts were present, their relative abundances, and the diversity of isoforms. Technical factors include how RNA molecules were captured, handled, and converted into sequenced fragments; biases related to sequence composition; random sampling variation due to finite sequencing depth; and artifacts introduced by handling and measurement. Biological variation also arises naturally—two samples from the same condition may differ in subtle ways due to stochastic gene expression and environmental differences. Even within a single sample, the observed fragments are an imperfect, partial snapshot of the underlying RNA population.

To interpret RNA-Seq data, it is common to compare observed fragments (often called reads) against a reference transcriptome, which is a collection of transcript sequences used as a mapping target and conceptual catalog of what might exist in the sample. Using a reference transcriptome provides a structured way to identify which transcript sequences are compatible with the observed fragments. The reference transcriptome can be thought of as the “menu” of transcripts that the quantification process is allowed to consider. When a fragment matches a region shared by multiple transcripts, that fragment alone may not uniquely identify the transcript of origin; nevertheless, across many fragments, the overall pattern of matches can provide enough information to infer transcript abundances.

The phrase “paired-end reads” describes a common style of sequencing data where each original RNA-derived fragment is observed from both ends, producing two related sequences per fragment. Conceptually, having two ends can provide additional context about where in a transcript a fragment might have come from, and can help distinguish between otherwise similar transcript sequences, especially when different transcript isoforms share some regions but differ elsewhere. Importantly, while paired-end sequencing offers more information than single-end sequencing, the underlying conceptual task remains the same: use the observed fragment evidence to determine the most consistent set of transcript expression values.

Expression quantification outputs are often described in terms of counts or abundance values. Counts typically represent how many fragments are attributed to a transcript, while abundance values might represent normalized measures that facilitate comparison across transcripts or samples. Regardless of the chosen representation, the conceptual objective is to obtain a transcript-by-transcript summary that accurately reflects the underlying mixture of transcripts that generated the reads. When the goal is transcript-level quantification, it is crucial to treat transcripts as distinct entities rather than collapsing everything to genes, because gene-level aggregation can hide isoform-specific expression changes. In many real analyses, transcript quantification can be used as a foundation for downstream questions such as differential expression, isoform switching, or condition-specific regulation. For example, differential expression (conceptually) asks whether expression differs between conditions, while isoform switching asks whether the relative proportions of a gene’s transcripts change even if the gene’s total output remains similar. These ideas underscore why transcript-level quantification is not merely bookkeeping—it can correspond to real biological hypotheses about regulation.

Fecal samples were prepared for a viral metagenomics investigation. The dolphin experienced a self-limiting gastroenteritis of suspected viral origin. We have available two reads datasets derived from the fecal sample material, and we want to determine the species identity of the most plausible viral agent(s) present.

Viral metagenomics is a broad approach used to explore the collection of viral genetic material in a specimen without requiring a prior assumption about which virus is present. In the context of gastroenteritis, this is especially relevant because many distinct viral families and species can cause overlapping clinical signs, and because viral shedding into feces can occur even when symptoms are resolving. Fecal material is also biologically complex: it can contain host-derived material, material from diet, abundant bacterial and archaeal nucleic acids, fungi, protozoa, and a wide assortment of bacteriophages alongside viruses that infect animals. This complexity means that any viral signal of interest may represent only a small fraction of the total genetic material present, and it may be fragmented, diverse, and mixed with sequences that resemble viral elements but are not necessarily from an actively replicating pathogen.

A key motivation for identifying viral species in such a sample is that “suspected viral origin” can refer to many possible biological scenarios. The causative agent might be a well-characterized enteric virus known to circulate in marine mammals, a virus commonly found in other hosts but capable of cross-species infection, a virus that is typically benign but can be associated with disease under certain conditions, or even a virus detected incidentally during illness but not responsible for symptoms. Additionally, some viruses detected in feces may originate from ingested prey or environmental exposure rather than from infection of the dolphin itself. Because of these possibilities, species-level identification is valuable: it provides a concrete taxonomic anchor that can be compared to known host ranges, known disease associations, and known ecological distributions.

In this task, the input consists of paired-end sequencing reads from the fecal sample. Conceptually, paired-end reads are two sequences that originate from the same original nucleic acid fragment, read from opposite ends. While they can provide complementary information that helps connect sequence context across a fragment, they should still be viewed as partial observations of longer molecules, and those molecules themselves are only a partial sampling of the biological material. Reads can originate from viral genomes, viral genome fragments, subgenomic pieces, or from genetic material of other organisms present in the sample. Reads may also contain repeated motifs, low-complexity regions, or sequences that resemble conserved domains shared across multiple viral groups. Because viruses evolve rapidly and frequently share structural or functional motifs, some sequences may be ambiguously assignable unless enough context is recovered.

The desired outcome is species identification of viral agents present. Here, “species” is used in the practical, taxonomic sense common in virology and sequence-based classification: a category defined by established naming and grouping conventions, typically represented in reference databases by sequences that have been previously curated and labeled. In sequence-driven viral discovery, species assignment can be challenging because viral diversity is vast and unevenly sampled. Some viral species are represented by many reference genomes and extensive literature, while others are known only from a handful of partial sequences. Some viruses also form continua of variation where boundaries between closely related species are debated or updated over time as more data becomes available. For the purpose of this task, species identification means producing a best-supported, specific viral taxon label(s) that reasonably explains the sequences observed, rather than only a broad category like “virus” or a very high-level group.

Because metagenomic evidence can include short fragments, another useful concept is the distinction between detection and attribution. Detection means there is evidence consistent with the presence of a virus or virus-like sequence in the sample. Attribution means connecting that evidence to a particular viral species in a way that is justified by sequence similarity, genomic context, and taxonomic coherence. It is possible, for instance, to detect sequences that are broadly “viral” or that match a conserved polymerase region shared by many related viruses, but not have enough unique sequence to confidently discriminate species. Conversely, a well-supported species match typically requires enough sequence context that the match is not driven solely by a short conserved motif. The task therefore emphasizes identifying viral species present in a way that balances sensitivity (not missing plausible candidates) and specificity (not over-claiming a species assignment from weak or generic evidence).

A common way to strengthen species-level conclusions from read data is to form longer contiguous sequences that represent a more complete stretch of a viral genome. In general terms, a “contig” is a longer sequence reconstructed from overlapping shorter sequences. Longer reconstructed sequences can capture a combination of conserved and variable regions, making taxonomic placement more reliable. Viral genomes often encode hallmark genes (for example, enzymes involved in replication or structural proteins) that provide recognizable signatures at the family or genus level, while other regions can be more distinctive at the species level. Having a longer stretch of sequence can therefore help resolve whether the sample contains a virus closely matching a known species, a divergent strain within a known species, or something that is only distantly related to cataloged viruses.

Classification of contigs, in conceptual terms, means determining what known biological entities a sequence most closely resembles and assigning an appropriate taxonomic label. This can be thought of as a structured comparison to collections of previously described sequences. Classification is not only about the best single match: it also involves judging whether matches are consistent across the contig, whether multiple contigs point to the same viral species, and whether the pattern of evidence suggests one dominant viral agent or several. In fecal samples, it is common to observe multiple viral taxa simultaneously, including bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, and sometimes viruses associated with diet or the environment. The identification goal here centers on potential viral agents relevant to the dolphin’s gastroenteritis, but the metagenomic reality is that sequences may reflect a mixture of sources. Therefore, species identification may include more than one viral species if the evidence supports multiple, while also recognizing that not all detected viruses are necessarily pathogenic in this context.

Another important conceptual point is that “gastroenteritis” is a syndrome—an observed set of symptoms—rather than a single disease entity. Viral gastroenteritis can be associated with different viral groups, and disease manifestation can depend on host factors such as age, immune status, prior exposure, and co-infections. In marine mammals, exposure can also be shaped by ecology, social behavior, and interactions with other species in shared habitats. The fecal virome can vary across individuals and over time, and an illness episode can coincide with changes in shedding dynamics. Because the episode described is self-limiting, it is plausible that the causative agent, if viral, could be one that the host cleared efficiently, or one that typically causes mild disease but can still produce noticeable symptoms.

It is also useful to distinguish between viruses that infect the dolphin’s cells and viruses that infect other organisms present in the sample. Bacteriophages can dominate fecal viromes and can be abundant even in healthy individuals; their presence is biologically meaningful but often not the primary suspect for gastroenteritis in a mammal. Similarly, viruses associated with prey species or other ingested organisms can appear in feces as “pass-through” signals. Environmental viral sequences can appear due to water exposure. Therefore, the species identification should focus on producing species-level viral labels supported by the sequences present, while being mindful that the sample may contain a broad assortment of viruses and virus-like sequences.

When reasoning about species identification from sequence data, it is also helpful to remember that viral taxonomy is periodically revised. Names can change, species can be split or merged, and newly discovered viruses can reshape the boundaries of existing groups. In practice, species names are often tied to reference sequences and curated taxonomies that reflect the best consensus at a given time. Thus, “identify the species” should be understood as: provide the most specific and defensible viral taxonomic assignment(s) based on the available sequence evidence, using established naming conventions that would be recognized in common viral reference collections.

The metagenomics dataset consists of sequencing reads derived from environmental samples collected in the Cuatro Ciénegas Basin, a uniquely structured aquatic and sedimentary ecosystem known for hosting diverse microbial life across fine-scale nutrient gradients. In this task, you are comparing microbial communities under two conditions: a control condition (JC1A) and a nutrient-enriched condition (JP4D). While both sets of reads originate from the same broader ecological setting, the key idea is that nutrient enrichment can shift which microbes thrive, which decline, and how the overall community composition redistributes across taxonomic groups.

Metagenomics, in the broad conceptual sense, is the study of genetic material recovered directly from a mixture of organisms present in a sample. Unlike approaches that focus on a single isolated organism, metagenomics aims to capture a “community snapshot” of many microbes at once—often bacteria, but potentially also archaea, viruses, and microbial eukaryotes depending on the sample and what is detectable. In practice, the raw material you start with is a large collection of short fragments of biological sequence information (reads) that collectively reflect the organisms whose DNA (or genetic material) was present in the sampled environment. Because environmental samples contain many organisms simultaneously, the reads are interleaved: fragments from different taxa are mixed together, and the analysis goal is to infer “who is there” and “in what proportions,” rather than reconstructing one single genome.

A central concept in community metagenomics is taxonomic composition, which refers to the list of taxa detected and their relative representation. A taxon is a named biological grouping such as a species, genus, family, order, class, or phylum. Depending on the data and how confidently reads can be attributed, taxonomic assignments may be made at different ranks. It is common in microbial community summaries to report abundances at a rank that is both informative and reasonably stable—often genus or family—though the appropriate rank can vary based on the confidence and granularity of classification. Importantly, taxa are not merely labels: they are a structured hierarchy, meaning that two distinct species may belong to the same genus, and multiple genera may belong to the same family, and so on. When comparing communities, shifts may be visible at multiple ranks, and sometimes signals that are subtle at species-level become clearer at higher ranks.

Another core concept is relative abundance. In most metagenomics community profiling settings, especially when comparing conditions, we care about how large a fraction of the community is represented by each taxon relative to the total. Relative abundance is typically expressed as a proportion or percentage: for example, “Taxon X constitutes 12% of detected bacterial reads in JC1A.” Relative abundance is valuable because it supports comparisons even when the total amount of sequence data differs between samples, as it normalizes by the total measured signal. However, relative abundance is also inherently compositional: if one taxon’s relative abundance increases, others must collectively decrease to keep the total at 100%. This means interpretations should focus on changes in community composition rather than assuming that every increase corresponds to absolute growth (unless absolute measurements are provided, which they are not here).

When thinking about nutrient enrichment in microbial ecosystems, it is helpful to frame it as a broad ecological perturbation. Nutrients can act as limiting resources; when they become more available, microbes that can quickly exploit them may become more prevalent, potentially outcompeting taxa adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Conversely, taxa that are specialized for low-nutrient environments may decline in relative representation if the enriched environment favors different metabolic strategies. Nutrient changes can also indirectly influence community structure by shifting interactions such as cross-feeding, competition, and niche partitioning. Importantly, the task does not require any narrative ecological interpretation; it focuses on accurately describing which bacterial taxa are present and their relative abundances in each condition.

It is also useful to understand what is meant by “profiling” in this context. Profiling means producing a structured inventory of bacterial taxa detected in each sample condition and quantifying their relative abundances. It does not imply mechanistic interpretation, functional annotation, or inference of metabolic pathways. The objective is not to speculate about why a taxon is present, nor to infer environmental parameters. Instead, it is an exercise in summarizing and comparing community membership and proportional representation in a consistent way.

The term “bacterial taxa” indicates that the report should focus specifically on bacteria rather than other biological groups. In mixed microbial datasets, there can be signals from non-bacterial sources; however, the reporting target here is bacterial composition. Conceptually, bacteria are one of the dominant microbial domains in many environmental communities, and bacterial taxonomic summaries are a standard output for metagenomics comparisons. The report should reflect bacterial taxa and their relative abundances, capturing the compositional profile of the community for each condition.

Because the data come from natural samples, it is worth keeping in mind some general properties of environmental sequencing-derived read collections. Environmental samples can contain uneven distributions of organisms: a small number of taxa may dominate while many others are present at low levels. Additionally, detection and apparent abundance can be influenced by biological and sampling factors such as community heterogeneity and stochastic sampling of rare taxa. Again, for this task, these are background considerations to support careful reporting, not instructions to perform any specific procedure.
